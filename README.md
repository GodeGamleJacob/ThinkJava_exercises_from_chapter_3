These tasks allowed me to make converters, using scanners and some simple calculus.
I hadn't played around with scanners all that much, and since I am still new in the game of programming, I spend waaayy to long on just figuring out, what to put where.
    
It was actually a bit harder, than it looks, cause the mini-game wouldn't let me insert any boundaries (initially I wanted to have a number between 1 and 100, but it kept adding radix and wouldn't run it, no matter, what I tried.
So now the game is just a little bit harder. :D
